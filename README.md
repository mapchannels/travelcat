"Travel Cat" is a game / exploration tool that combines Google Photorealistic 3D Maps, Google Street View and Google 2D Maps. In "Travel Cat" you control a cat with a thirst for adventure who can travel and explore any location in the world. You have a choice of vehicle: plane, car or boat. 

FLY MODE
Fly mode works like a simple flight simulator. Steer the plane by moving the mouse over the 3D Map:
	Upper screen to climb
	Lower screen area to dive
	Left screen area to turn left
	Right screeb area to turn right
	
Use the keyboard controls W and S to accelerate or decelerate. Use the Control key to stop completely.
You can switch to drive mode by clicking on a nearby location on the 3D map. 
Tip: pressing SPACE BAR will pause all travel and make it simpler to select a location on the 3D Map.
If the map location you click on has street view imagery then you will change to drive mode. 

FLY MODE CAMERA MODES
Press the V key to view the flight from different camera angles. Holding down the R key is a useful way to view the scenery behind you when the plane is climbing.

PHYSICS
There is no speed limit, collision detection or aerodynamics so you can do what you want without breaking the plane. 

DRIVE MODE
In drive mode steer the car using the street view interface. Within the street view panorama you can drag the screen to change your heading and your car will attempt to travel in that direction.
The system is semi-automatic. Sometimes it is possible that you will get stuck when there is not adjacent street view in the direction you are travelling. You can manually navigate by clicking the street view direction arrows. You can also click on the 3D map to change location. 
Drive mode can also be used to travel on water. To keep it realistic you can press B and change your vehicle to a boat (there isn't yet a way to detect if a street view panorama is on water or land).
Press the escape key to return to fly mode and you will switch to the plane at an aerial location just above your current ground location.

EXPORT KML
Click the EXPORT button on the 2D Map to save your current route as a KML file. You can use this KML to view your route later using other software such as Google Earth.
	
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS
The current game is a fairly simple tech demo to get the fundamentals working. More features are planned. Also working on colaborative projects is possible if you want to help develop the code further.
